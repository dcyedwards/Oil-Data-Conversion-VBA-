                                                      -------
1. This repository contains an Excel workbook which demonstrates the conversion of (fictitious) oil production data from US dollars per      barrel a day (bbl/d) to kilo-tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe). The process when done automatically runs in approximately 3 minutes as      oppposed to three to four days when done manually as considerable checking and validation has to be done at each stage.

2. It looks at the annual oil production of over 950 oil fields - or crude streams - and applies one of seven oil quality (API) factors or    assumptions.

3. It does this across a period of 35 years and plots the converted units in a pivot table at the end. These converted units then get fed    (automatically) into a database. However the database process is not included in this repository.
